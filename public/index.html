After two years of &quot;study&quot; I decided to leave the campus and pursue knowledge on my own. It was the best decision of my life.</p>

                <p>This project was in fact primary reason to drop out of school. I have acquainted a group of enthusiastic people through AIESEC and Technology Incubators, and we decided to team up in our freelance projects. We started well, we were full of ideas and dreams, we had few loyal clients. However, in the long run, we had no idea what we are doing. Expected as it was, the company went belly up after a year of activity.</p>
                <p>Regardless the outcome, it was incredibly valuable experience to me. I have masterd Ruby and Rails to perfection. I had occasion to work with GPS systems. I had a glimpse of how search engines and SEO work. Last but not least, I deployed my very first distributed app - oh my, it was a Rails app scaled on three separate servers - madness!</p>

                <p>Hungry for new adventures, I moved to Cracow, to join local software house. I did not expect to stay there so long, especially after accidentally removing all websites of our clients upon my first deploy... Our sysadmin wanted to kill me, but he did finally set up proper backups and redundancy after the incident...</p>
                <p>I started there as Rails developer - working mostly on apps for commerce, and loyality programs. However, I quickly got the opportunity to work with number of technologies. Discovering no-SQL databases was at the time the biggest breakthrough in my career. Later, I had a chance to work with heavily distributed message queues as well as a real misfortune to have a MongoDB in production... in 2010...</p>
                <p>We had fantastic time at Araneo. We had purpose, we had fun, we supported each other, and we made some really good apps. Even though the company does not exist anymore, we stay friends. R.I.P. Araneo, and thank you for everything.</p>

                <p>Working at Cubox opened my eyes to software crafsmanship. We did awesome apps for cool clients, we grew together, we had fun doing it. We wrote open source during the working hours! We went to conferences, we organised conferences. Cubox thought me true culture of hacking. For this, and everything they did for me, I shall be always greatful.</p>

                <p>Five hundred millions of real estate records, with real time, corellative search. Weekly updates from multiple sources. Greedy API consumers. That was the challenge in a nutshell.</p>
                <p>We inherited a PHP app, tons of fixed-width data files, and constantly crashing MySQL server. We ended up with RESTful API handled by Java on Google App Engine, Elasticsearch cluster serving corellation queries, BigTable and Data Pipelines processing the updates, and sharded, redundant MySQL databases serving the data in real time.</p>
                <p>This system, despite dealing with boring real estate data, was by far my biggest challenge, and most valuable production experience so far. It was undeniably the biggest one as well.</p>

                <p>I was hired as an architect, oddly enough, I didn't feel like it for a single moment at this job. Six months of embracing
                chaos, facing mistrust. and dealing with beaurocracy. Lesson learned, no matter the benefits, I shall never again enter a startup bubble.</p>
