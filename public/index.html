            <h4>Greetings!</h4>
            <p>My name is Krzysztof, though feel free to call me Kris. I was born in post-soviet Poland, however, over the course of my life I became a nomad. I jump from place to place every now and then to learn more about the World. So far I managed to stay a little longer in Buenos Aires, Berlin, Seoul, Madrid and my beloved Montevideo.</p>
            <p>As it comes to communication, I speak and write fluent English and Spanish from La Plata, not bad Spanish from Spain, native Polish and basic Russian. French, Finnish, Korean and Japanese are in my backlog.</p>
            <p>I met first computer when I was 11, it was a green iMac G3 at my primary school. I fell in love. I had to wait couple of years more for the first computer of my own. Once there, it did not take me long to discover programming and turn into a child of the internet.</p>
            <p>Throughout my programming career I did commercial projects in Ruby, Python, Java/Scala, Node, Go, C/C++, and even Perl. I'm fluent with web technologies, including websockets, streaming and animations. Databases? You name it. I did consulting in PostrgeSQL, MySQL, Elasticsearch, BigTable and Redis, I am also familiar with Dynamo, Riak, and RethinkDB. I spent over ten years exploring nuisances of Linux, starting from Gentoo, through Red Hat, on Debian finishing. I have experience with BSD family as well. At work, as well as in my life I devotedly follow UNIX philosophy.</p>
            <p>Apart from hacking my way through, I am also an aspiring artist, writer, photographer, and freestyle skater. I fancy chess play, ambitious music, asian culture and cousine, fantasy books, and above anything else, cinema. Upon dusk of my programming career I want to open small creative studio and make beautifull, psychedellic animations.</p>
            <p>Please, feel free to scroll through my resume, and if you find me worthy your acquaintance, you can find my contact information down below.</p>

The work was easy and I had plenty of time to read dozens of books. I was an avid reader already, but that job turned me into a complete book worm.</p>

After two years of &quot;study&quot; I decided to leave the campus and pursue knowledge on my own. It was the best decision of my life.</p>

                <p>This project was in fact primary reason to drop out of school. I have acquainted a group of enthusiastic people through AIESEC and Technology Incubators, and we decided to team up in our freelance projects. We started well, we were full of ideas and dreams, we had few loyal clients. However, in the long run, we had no idea what we are doing. Expected as it was, the company went belly up after a year of activity.</p>
                <p>Regardless the outcome, it was incredibly valuable experience to me. I have masterd Ruby and Rails to perfection. I had occasion to work with GPS systems. I had a glimpse of how search engines and SEO work. Last but not least, I deployed my very first distributed app - oh my, it was a Rails app scaled on three separate servers - madness!</p>

                <p>Five hundred millions of real estate records, with real time, corellative search. Weekly updates from multiple sources. Greedy API consumers. That was the challenge in a nutshell.</p>
                <p>We inherited a PHP app, tons of fixed-width data files, and constantly crashing MySQL server. We ended up with RESTful API handled by Java on Google App Engine, Elasticsearch cluster serving corellation queries, BigTable and Data Pipelines processing the updates, and sharded, redundant MySQL databases serving the data in real time.</p>
                <p>This system, despite dealing with boring real estate data, was by far my biggest challenge, and most valuable production experience so far. It was undeniably the biggest one as well.</p>

                <p>I have been occasionally advising Vamos since the very beginning, I loved the idea. No wonder guys reached out to me the moment I set my foot in Berlin. After quite a bumpy road, I designed Elasticsearch indices plus Ruby client to handle their event recommendations and search.</p>

                <p>You are probably wondering what the heck is this suppose to mean? Well, I discovered rollerblading when I was 20, some time later I started breaking my bones on Freestyle Slalom. Last year, after long rehab and recovery from the injury, I went berserk with training. I took a career break to compete in slalom series of Paris, Moscow, Namwon, Qingdao and Warsaw. I finished the season ranked 21 in the World. No, it has nothing to do with programming, but it shows what am I capable of when motivated and cut loose.</p>

                <p>I was hired as an architect, oddly enough, I didn't feel like it for a single moment at this job. Six months of embracing
                chaos, playing pointless polytics, and dealing with beaurocracy. Lesson learned, no matter the benefits, I shall never again enter a startup bubble.</p>
