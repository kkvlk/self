# Self

I grew up in post-soviet 90s, which are pretty much like 80s on steroids. Code, pixels, chiptune, glitch. Pegasus and Commodore. Mega Man and Zelda! Matrix and Ergo Proxy. WarGames and Tron. Captain Tsubasa, Saint Seyia... Ghost in the Shell! A vivid imagination of hacking culture, a vivid memory of my childhood dreams. Here I am, 15 years later. A hacker.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Build project:

    ```
    ./build
    ```

3. Start local web server:

    ```
    ./serve
    ```

    Once up, http://localhost:5000/ shall serve the website.
