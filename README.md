# Self

I was raised by post-soviet 90s, which were pretty much like 80s on steroids. Code, pixels, chiptune, glitch. Pegasus and Commodore. Mega Man and Zelda! Matrix and Tron WarGames and Terminator. Star Trek and Babylon 5. Captain Tsubasa, Saint Seyia... Ghost in the Shell! A vivid imagination of hacking culture, a vivid memory of my childhood dreams. Here I am, 15 years later. A hacker.

2. Build project:

    ```
    ./build
    ```

3. Start local web server:

    ```

    Once up, [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) shall serve the website.
